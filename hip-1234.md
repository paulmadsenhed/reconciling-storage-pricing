## Abstract

This specification proposes reconciling the cost of storage for Hedera state entities like accounts, topics, tokens, files, and smart contracts such that, for each entity type, we charge the same USD/byte hour across 
transactions that create an entity, those that update it, and when those entities auto renew.
