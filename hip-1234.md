## Abstract

This specification proposes reconciling the cost of storage for Hedera state entities like accounts, topics, tokens, files, and smart contracts such that, for each entity type, we charge the same USD/byte hour across transactions that create an entity, those that update it, and when those entities auto renew.

## Motivation

Hedera charges 'rent' for entities persisted in state like accounts, topics, tokens, files, and smart contracts. If and when an entity cannot pay its rent, it will be removed from state.

When entities are first created, the amount of storage space they will use (measured in byte hours) is calculated, and multiplied by a storage rent rate (denominated in tinydollars per bytehour) to determine the contribution of rent towards the fee for the transaction creating the entity. The storage rent rate is specified in the fee schedule file that all nodes use in calculating fees.

The account paying for the transaction is charged the total fee, which includes the storage component and other components reflecting the transaction's bandwidth and computational burden.

Similarly, when the entity is updated, or when it auto renews, to extend its expiration, another rent calculation is performed and the appropriate fee charged to the relevant account.

Accounts, topics, and tokens are stored in RAM, and the corresonding  rent rate is listed as a rbh 'ram byte hours' value in the fee schedule. 

Files, and smart contracts are stored on disk, and the corresponding rent rate is listed as a sbh 'storage byte hours' value in the fee schedule.

Rent for RAM and disk storage is priced differently, reflecting the greater scarcity of RAM. 

The rent rate for an entity (that manifests as either an rbh or sbh value in the fee schedule is determined by a formula that considers  

- a stipulated typical price for the transaction creating the entity or extending its expiration
- the scarcity of the resource being used for storage, either RAM or disk
- default assumptions about how large is the entity in state, e.g. how many keys are on an account, whether there is a memo on a token etc

Hedera generates the rent rate coefficients (and other coefficients for bandwidth and computational burden) and publishes them in the fee schedule file for nodes to use in fee calculations.

As the stipulated prices are generally different for the transactions that create, update and auto renew an entity, so too generally are the rent coefficients. As an example, the rbh coefficients for creating an HBAR account, later updating the account, and auto renewing the account (when supported) are all different - even though they are paying for the same resource usage. 

This HIP proposes reconciling the storage pricing model so that, for each of the entity types, the storage rent coefficient is similar for all of the create, update and auto renew transactions.

## Rationale

For a given entity type, it is logical that rent be charged the same for the transactions that first create the entity, update it to extend its lifetime, or have that lifetime autorenew.

## Specification

When generating the fee schedule, for each entity type the stipulated prices for updates and auto renews will be chosen such that the resulting rent fee is similar (e.g. within 2%) to that for the corresponding create transaction. 

For each entity type

1. Using the stipulated price for the create transaction, determine the rent coefficient (either rbh or sbh)
2. For the corresponding update transaction, determine which USD fee will result in the same rent coefficient. Set that as the stipulated USD fee for the update.
3. For the corresponding auto renewal , determine which USD fee will result in the same rent coefficient. Set that as the stipulated USD fee for auto renewal.

Using the above model, the proposed prices for creating, updating, and auto renewing state entities are

		        USD
Accounts		
	Create	0.0500
	AutoRenew	0.0014
	Update	0.0044
		
Topics		
	Create	0.0100
	AutoRenew	0.0003
	Update	0.0009
		
Tokens		
	Create	1.0000
	AutoRenew	0.0259
	Update	0.0730
		
Files		
	Create	0.0500
	AutoRenew	0.0014
	Update	0.0053
		
Smart Contracts		
	Create	1.0000
	AutoRenew	0.0641
	Update	0.0778

## Backwards Compatibility

This HIP changes the prices of some existing update transactions and could cause transactions to fail with an INSUFFICIENT_FEE error of the client has hard-coded in fees and the new fee is higher than previous.
